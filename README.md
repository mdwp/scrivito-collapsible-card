A collabsible card React component/Scrivito widget for the Scrivito CMS. 

## Installation

Open your terminal.

`$ cd` to your Scrivito project

```
$ npm install scrivito-collabsible-card
```

Import the widget in your javascript (e.g. in `index.js` or `Widgets/index.js`).

Add this line to your index.js:

```
import "scrivito-collabsible-card";
```

Also add the styling of the widget to your app. This can be done by either loading it via `css-loader` (e.g. in `index.js` or `Widgets/index.js`):

```
import "scrivito-collabsible-card/index.css";
```

Or by including the styling to your style sheets (e.g. in `index.scss`):

```scss
@import "~scrivito-collabsible-card/index.css";
```


## Features
The Collabsible Card Widget renders a card with a header and a collabsible body. You can put any widget into the body.

With `npm start` you'll start a continues process, that rebuilds `build/` automatically once the source code is changed.

```
npm install file:<path to build folder>
```

e.g.

```
npm install file:../scrivito-collabsible-card/build/
```

To publish the package:

npm i && npm run build && cd build/ && npm publish
```
